The following repository contains links from various DSA platforms to practise

The procedure to learn 
There is a google sheet that contains the problems where you can learn and solve them on the particular platform such as HackerRank, Leetcode

Once the code is running successfully, you need to copy the code and in the github you move to the folder such as HR for HackRank and create a file there,
the file name should be the problem name you solved on the website and paste the code in the file created
and then commit the changes

Maintain the consistency, 1 problem a day
